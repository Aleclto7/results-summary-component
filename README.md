## Overview

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Git and GitHub
- JavaScript
- Local JSON data

### What I learned

Most of what I used in this challenge I already know to me, much of the Html and Css. However I had to do a lot of research to find out how to use local JSON data, at the beginning it was very difficult, but as time went by I understood it and in the end I succeeded.

I know it's not the best way to do it and it's not best practice either but as I progress through the difficulty of the challenges I will start to learn how to do it better

### Continued development

One of the things that I think would be very useful and would make me improve a lot is to learn a css framework and technologies like React.

### Useful resources

- [Trabajando con JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) - This helped me to know how to work with JSON in my project.
- [Cambiar el src de una imagen con javascript](https://donnierock.com/2017/09/19/cambiar-el-src-de-una-imagen-con-javascript-o-jquery/) - This helped me to change the 'src' property in the HTML tag from the values of the JSON object.
